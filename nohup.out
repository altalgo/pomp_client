[HPM] Error occurred while trying to proxy request /api/auth/user from localhost:3000 to http://.leed.at (ENOTFOUND) (https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors)
The build failed because the process exited too early. This probably means the system ran out of memory or someone called `kill -9` on the process.
